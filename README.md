PROJECT NAME

"Link With Me" by Christopher Randall

In this project I wanted to create an employee/freelance showcase style website where employers can come and browse through future employees and admire their work and get a feel for the person they may potentially hire.

UX

This website is focused solely for employees and freelance workers who are looking for employment or simply to showcase their work and also for employers who are looking to recruit some new faces. This site should feel clean and pleasing to the eye but with nice visuals and pleasing transition animations. The "My Story" section provides a nice insight into the person and the "My Work" section showcases some previous works and also an insight as to how the person got started in their chosen field.

FEATURES

The first feature that everyone who visits this site will see is the "split" profile picture which has a nice hover animation coupled with the full colour background to offset the text.

Next is the scroll animation with page markers on the right hand side which are also animated and can be interacted with.

I decided to go for a simple header as to not take away from the main page and individual pages.

Inside the individual pages you will find a nice banner displaying the persons name and job title

Next is the "My Story" section which provides a small snippet of the person and their story.

Next is the "My Work" section which showcases the persons previous works and also a short paragraph detailing previous employers/places of work and also how they first got started in their chosen field.

TECHNOLOGIES USED

Technologies used were as follows:

- HTML5 to build the site.

- CSS to style the site.

- JavaScript to implement animations and hover functions.

My automated tests for this project are as follows:

- Clicking on all links to ensure they worked as intended.

- Testing the scroll functions to ensure functionality.

- Testing the scroll functions to ensure the scroll animations worked properly as well as teh "next page" animations worked efficiently.

- Making sure the hamburger icon open the header/nav bar.

My steps to deploying my project were as follows:

- I first created a new repository on GitHub.

- Next I changed my Source to Masterbranch in the repository settings.

- Next I opened my new repository in GitPod.

- Then I pushed my code to the new repository.
