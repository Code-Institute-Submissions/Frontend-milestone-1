				<h3>My Story</h3>
				<p>
					Ever since I was a child I had an interest in cameras, from the toy camera that would change
					images
					when you clicked the shutter, to an old poloroid camera my Father used to own. Some would say it
					was
					my calling but for me it was just something I loved to do and I was lucky enough to make it my
					profession.
				</p>
				<p>
					I orignally started out posting my shots online and sharing them with friends but as my work
					began
					to get more and more attention I found myself being scouted for work pretty regularly and the
					jobs
					ranged greatly from small events to big magazines wanting to use my photos. I was astounded at
					how
					much people liked my photos so I decided I would make this my career and the rest is history.

					<h3>My Work</h3>
					<p>
						Although I started out with many small events such as birthday parties and christenings I
						steadily began to climb the ranks if you will. I began to get bigger and bigger gigs such as
						weddings, which are a big deal in my opinion, to jobs for smaller magazines and newspapers
						until
						I got my big break in the form of The New York Times! This is my greatest achievement to
						date
						and
						something I am very proud of.
					</p>
					<p>
						I had worked for many different newspapers in Ireland in the past but to get a call from The
						New
						York Times was mind boggling and I was pretty stunned. Having my photos in probably the most
						famous newspaper in the world was something I could hardly believe.
