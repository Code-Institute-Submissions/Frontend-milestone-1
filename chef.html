				<h3>My Story</h3>
				<p>
					My story began when I was still young. My mother was the best cook in the world in my eyes and we
					used to cook on the weekends making the cliche buns and cakes but it swiftly escalated as my love
					for cooking grew rapidly. Soon I was preparing meals for family and testing recipes on friends
					trying to perfect my craft. From there I went to culinary school and graduated with high honours
					which landed me my first job.
				</p>
				<p>
					For me there is no greater joy than cooking a meal and recieving good feedback and learning that the
					recipient thoroughly enjoyed their experience. I am lucky enough to have found my passion in life
					from an early age and had the platform to pursue that dream but I would never have gotten as far as
					I
					did without those weekend cooking marathons with my Mother.

					<h3>My Work</h3>
					<p>
						I have worked in many restaurants throughout my career but for me the stand out kitchens have to
						be
						Club Gascon in London and Guy Savoy in Paris. I had the pleasure of working in both of these
						restaurants as Head Chef and if I could go back in time I wouldn't change a thing!
					</p>
					<p>
						Hopefully one day I will have the resources to open and run my own restaurant like some of my
						idols but for now I want to cook and create delicious meals and maybe be an inspiration for some
						younger chefs who are just up and coming and learning their trade and hopefully I can pass on
						some wisdom and knowledge to the next generation.
