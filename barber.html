				<h3>My Story</h3>
				<p>
					My story is a simple one. It all started in my fathers barber shop, I would spend my evenings there
					after school sitting around watching him cut hair and have a great time doing it. It was like he was
					friends with everyone who sat in his chair and the vibe in the shop was always positive no matter
					the topic.
				</p>
				<p>
					I started out by sweeping up the hair on the floor and helping in any way I could but as
					tme went on I realised that maybe this is what I was meant to do. I loved the atmosphere, the happy
					feel of the place and the friendship that came from a haircut and the conversations had in that
					time. So I decided I would follow in my fathers footsteps!

					<h3>My Work</h3>
					<p>
						As soon as I graduated from school I immediately enrolled in barber college. I wanted to get
						qualified and join my fathers business and as soon as I could! After college I worked for my
						father for a short time until I decided I wanted to better my skills as a barber. I decided to
						work in various different establishments and learn as many techniques as I could to better my
						own skills and experience.
					</p>
					<p>
						I have spend many many hours perfecting my craft working for some of the most skilled barbers
						around and one day I hope to be a barber to the stars and compete in the barber world
						championships where I can showcase my skills and dedication to this profession.
